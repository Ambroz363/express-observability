# Observability - NodeJS

The purpose of this project is to try to document how to implement observability in a Node environment.

## Setup

1. NodeJS
2. Prometheus
3. Loki
4. Tempo
5. Grafana
6. Docker

## Run

To start `docker compose up -d`

## Thinks to keep in mind

1. Use TS :D
2. Read PORTS and other creds from an env.

## Future

As time goes on I will try to add more stuff in here.

1. I will try to add more node services in here and do a microservice setup.
2. Will add a persistent DB, few more endpoints and simulate a more production env.
